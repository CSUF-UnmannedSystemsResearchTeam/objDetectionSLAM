# objDetection
Object detection script for processing either live video streams or video files andn saving it to a local playable file.

This particular script is written specifically for post-processing but can be easily modified for a live-stream.
With further modification and addition of the pymavlink library, the script can be written to accept a live-stream, recognize an object, and act upon the detection using mavlink commands.
